        is just as cheap/fast, hence, there is apparently no need for a struct

        For the rest, Int[], etc. are still raw C arrays, for compatibility
        with C functions.</P

>Java and C# suffer from the drawbacks of general-purpose
        languages running on Virtual Machines. Namely, they tend to be
        bloated, to have heavy runtime libraries, and to be significantly less
        performant than compiled languages in certain situations. However,
        it's true that with JIT (Just-In-Time) technology, a VM language can
        run almost as fast as a compiled language, in certain situations. See
        the <A

>Vala is a language with the same spirit/mission as ooc. It looks
        very good, but it's deeply tied to the GLib architecture. ooc tries to
        base itself only on the C standard library. Vala is more adapted to
        gtk/gnome development.</P

><P
>Not much. These are all excellent languages and have quality
        implementations. They're good at what they're used for. ooc is not in
        direct competition with these languages. D is a sad case of very good
        ideas doomed by half-openness, diverging and lagging free software
        implementations, stalling between 1.0 and 2.0, etc.</P

        you.</P
